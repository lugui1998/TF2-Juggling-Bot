# TF2-Juggling-Bot


This is a fun side project I created to beat [Shounic's Juggling contest](https://youtu.be/D06tRhV1gYE).

It may be used as a refference on sourcemod serverside physics prediction (It is not perfect tho).

The included gamedata is required in order to get the Balls's velocity vectors. It has only been tested on Windows.
